# Front End Bootcamp

There are four sub-repos under this project:

- `front-end-demos` has demonstrations of plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- `front-end-labs` has labs that use plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- `react-demos` has demonstrations of React code for the React portion of the class
- `react-labs` has exercises for the React portion of the class.

Do **NOT** open the root of the repository in your IDE of choice.

## Set up

Run `npm install` in the root directory. This will set up dependencies for all sub projects.

For `*-demos` directories, you can open then directly in the IDE.

For `*-labs` directories, open the `*-apps` directory in your IDE.

For any given sub-project:

- Open a terminal/command prompt
- Run `npm run dev` to start the server associated with the project.
